One of the most perplexing parts of healthcare is patient-related data. The existing pool of data becomes larger and larger with each new addition to the patient database. Medical data storage and retrieval must be managed securely and is a source of worry. This is where we come in. To securely store encrypted patient records, we employ IPFS technology, which is distributed and immutable storage. The patient has the option of downloading his or her medical records. The patient has complete control over their medical information and, with their permission, may safely share their data with doctors/insurance providers. Based on their conditions, patients will be provided suggestions for health insurance coverage that will benefit them. Medicines recommended by doctors will also be freely available in PDF format for download.

Our integrated voice assistant (which will support regional languages in the future) makes it easier for patients to arrange medical appointments. The availability of specialised doctors will determine their appointment. The patient can reschedule their appointment timings.

Most of them have been suffering from mental stress in recent years. To enhance mental wellness, our voice assistant listens to the patient's everyday issues and provides a plethora of information and suggestions. It is designed particularly for younger people to assist them in dealing with their own issues.
